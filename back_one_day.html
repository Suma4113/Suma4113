        <h4>Song by NEFFEX and TheFatRat</h4>
<pre>
All the roads we travelled
The journey of our lives
Take another picture
Before we say goodbye
Arm in arm we're standing
Standing side by side
Memories fade but legends never die

One last time let's live for something
I can feel my blood it's rushing
This ain't goodbye we'll be back someday
And we will find our way
Take control of our fate
And like a car with no brakes
Crash and learn make mistakes
And we'll be back one day
We'll be back one day

I don't really ever wanna hold back
I got dreams wanna go fast
Know this energy's here to last
Not a glass half full overflow that uh
Gotta Keep your eyes up on the prize
Only got one life so it's worth a try
To find what makes you feel alive
That's the only way to live it right uh
And now we're all doing our own things
But I'll never forget our glory days
My mind is full of the memories yea
And I'll never forget what they meant to me
Don't worry we'll be back one day
Just celebrate our glory days
We'll be back one day

Although it's over now
Don't let it get you down
We'll be back around
For now we can feel some sorrow
A new day it starts tomorrow
We'll wake up
New dreams to follow
A new goal and brand new motto

One last time let's live for something
I can feel my blood it's rushing
This ain't goodbye we'll be back someday
And we will find our way
Take control of our fate
And like a car with no brakes
Crash and learn make mistakes
And we'll be back one day
We'll be back one day
We'll be back one day
